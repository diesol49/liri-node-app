# Liri Node.js

## Description
    For class, we were tasked to make a Siri knockoff and call it Liri, which stands for, *Language Interpreation and Recognition Interface*. Liri will be in charge of 3 things:
        -Searching for movies :clapper:
        -Searching for bands in nearby towns :guitar:
        -Searching for music through Spotify :headphones:

## How are we going to do this?

Objective | Type in Terminal
------  | -------
List bands in town | node liri.js concert-this <band>
Display Spotify song | node liri.js spotify-this-song <song title>
Display movie info | node liri.js movie-this <title>

## Spotify
If everything worked as intended, you should see the following:
